        <h2>My Vision</h2>
        <div class="vision">
            <p>I believe that every child deserves the opportunity to become a creator, not just a consumer. With the right tools, guidance, and inspiration, kids can learn to code — and in the process, develop skills that will shape their entire future.</p>
            <p>As <strong>Narayana Murthy</strong> rightly said, "India's school education is extremely poor. We are producing people who are not thinking, who are not learning how to learn." It's time we shift from rote learning to real-world skills, starting with something as accessible and joyful as coding.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Teach kids to code using platforms like <strong>Scratch</strong>.</li>
            <li>Create project-based learning videos on my YouTube channel <a href="#">"Code With Shubha"</a>.</li>
            <li>Design fun, interactive lessons that build logic, creativity, and problem-solving skills.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
        <p>Coding isn't just about computers. It's about thinking clearly, solving problems, building confidence, and bringing ideas to life. It's the literacy of the future — and I want to make sure every child has access to it.</p>

        <h2>Join the Mission</h2>
        <p>Let's work together to reimagine education. Join me in this journey of empowering kids with skills that truly matter. <a href="#">Subscribe to my channel</a>, share the message, and let's build a generation of thinkers and creators.</p>
